/***********************************************************************
*  The structure LUF defines LU-factorization of a square matrix A and
*  is the following quartet:
*
*     [A] = (F, V, P, Q),                                            (1)
*
*  where F and V are such matrices that
*
*     A = F * V,                                                     (2)
*
*  and P and Q are such permutation matrices that the matrix
*
*     L = P * F * inv(P)                                             (3)
*
*  is lower triangular with unity diagonal, and the matrix
*
*     U = P * V * Q                                                  (4)
*
*  is upper triangular. All the matrices have the order n.
*
*  Matrices F and V are stored in row- and column-wise sparse format
*  as row and column linked lists of non-zero elements. Unity elements
*  on the main diagonal of matrix F are not stored. Pivot elements of
*  matrix V (which correspond to diagonal elements of matrix U) are
*  stored separately in an ordinary array.
*
*  Permutation matrices P and Q are stored in ordinary arrays in both
*  row- and column-like formats.
*
*  Matrices L and U are completely defined by matrices F, V, P, and Q
*  and therefore not stored explicitly.
*
*  The factorization (1)-(4) is a version of LU-factorization. Indeed,
*  from (3) and (4) it follows that:
*
*     F = inv(P) * L * P,
*
*     U = inv(P) * U * inv(Q),
*
*  and substitution into (2) leads to:
*
*     A = F * V = inv(P) * L * U * inv(Q).
*
*  For more details see the program documentation. */
