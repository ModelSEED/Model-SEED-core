/***********************************************************************
*  The structure FHV defines the factorization of the basis mxm-matrix
*  B, where m is the number of rows in corresponding problem instance.
*
*  This factorization is the following sextet:
*
*     [B] = (F, H, V, P0, P, Q),                                     (1)
*
*  where F, H, and V are such matrices that
*
*     B = F * H * V,                                                 (2)
*
*  and P0, P, and Q are such permutation matrices that the matrix
*
*     L = P0 * F * inv(P0)                                           (3)
*
*  is lower triangular with unity diagonal, and the matrix
*
*     U = P * V * Q                                                  (4)
*
*  is upper triangular. All the matrices have the same order m, which
*  is the order of the basis matrix B.
*
*  The matrices F, V, P, and Q are stored in the structure LUF (see the
*  module GLPLUF), which is a member of the structure FHV.
*
*  The matrix H is stored in the form of eta file using row-like format
*  as follows:
*
*     H = H[1] * H[2] * ... * H[nfs],                                (5)
*
*  where H[k], k = 1, 2, ..., nfs, is a row-like factor, which differs
*  from the unity matrix only by one row, nfs is current number of row-
*  like factors. After the factorization has been built for some given
*  basis matrix B the matrix H has no factors and thus it is the unity
*  matrix. Then each time when the factorization is recomputed for an
*  adjacent basis matrix, the next factor H[k], k = 1, 2, ... is built
*  and added to the end of the eta file H.
*
*  Being sparse vectors non-trivial rows of the factors H[k] are stored
*  in the right part of the sparse vector area (SVA) in the same manner
*  as rows and columns of the matrix F.
*
*  For more details see the program documentation. */
