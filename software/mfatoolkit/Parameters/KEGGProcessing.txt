database to process|KEGG|0|Database information
calculate properties from groups|1|This binary parameter indicates whether or not the compound charge and deltaG should be recalculated based on the properties of the structural cues contained in the compound.|Compound calculation specifications
load compound structure|1|This binary parameter indicates whether or not the compound structures should be read in from the database molfiles. Molfiles must have the same name as the compound database ID.|Compound calculation specifications
load cue structures|1|"This binary parameter indicates whether or not the structures for the structural cues should be loaded. This parameter MUST be set to ""1"" whenever you plan to decompose molecules into structural cues."|Compound calculation specifications
determine stringcode|1|"This binary parameter indicates whether or not the stringcodes for the molecules should be recalculated based on the structure loaded for the molecules. The ""load compound structure"" parameter MUST be set to one in order for stringcodes to be recalculated."|Compound calculation specifications
look for cycles|1|"This binary parameter indicates that the MFAToolkit should search each compound's structure for cycles. This can be a time consuming calculation, but it MUST be performed in order for stringcodes to be calculated or atoms to be labeled."|Compound calculation specifications
label atoms|1|This binary parameter indicates whether or not each molecular structure should be broken down into structural cues. This is required for the estimation of thermodynamic properties.|Compound calculation specifications
determine formula from structure file|1|This binary parameter indicates whether or not the molecular formula of each compound should be recalculated from the molfile read in for the compound.|Compound calculation specifications
print compounds|1|Indicates whether or not the database compounds will be printed into the combined database file|Data calculation specifications
print model data|1|Indicates whether or not the database will be printed into a combined database file vertically arranged in columns with headers at the top of the file.|Data calculation specifications
print reactions|1|Indicates whether or not the database reactions will be printed into the combined database file|Data calculation specifications
poll structural cues|1|This binary parameter indicates whether or not a histogram should be generated indicating how often each structural cue occurs in the compounds and reactions.|Data calculation specifications
output folder|KEGGProcessing/|"This is the specific folder located in the ""output path"" where the results from the current run will be stored."|Filenames required for proper program start up
compound data to print|INPUT_HEADER;DELTAG;DELTAGERR;CHARGE;STRUCTURAL_CUES;STRINGCODE;MFATOOLKIT ERRORS|"This indicates the data that should be printed in the compound flat files. The term ""INPUT_HEADER"" means that the output file should contain the same headers as the input file."|Headers indicating what data should be printed in the database flatfiles
reaction data to print|INPUT_HEADER;DELTAG;DELTAGERR;STRUCTURAL_CUES;MFATOOLKIT ERRORS|"This indicates the data that should be printed in the reaction flat files. The term ""INPUT_HEADER"" means that the output file should contain the same headers as the input file."|Headers indicating what data should be printed in the database flatfiles
calculate group change|1|This binary variable indicates whether the change in structural cues during the reaction should be determined.|Reaction calculation specifications
balance reactions|1|This binary variable indicates whether the reactions in the model should be checked to make sure they are charge and mass balanced.|Reaction calculation specifications
calculate energy from groups|1|This binary variable indicates whether the deltaG should be calculated from the structural cues involved in the reaction.|Reaction calculation specifications
automatically add H to balance|1|This binary variable indicates whether H+ should be added when the hydrogens in a reaction are imbalanced. H+ is only add if H is the only imbalanced atom in the reaction.|Reaction calculation specifications
