1.) Clone the git repository for the Model SEED
	a.) Install git on whatever system you want to install the Model SEED onto
	b.) On the command line, go to the root directory where you want to put the Model SEED installation
	c.) Clone the repository from git with this command:
	"git clone git://github.com/cshenry/Model-SEED-core"
2.) Download and install the flatfile data
	a.) Download the default flat file datafiles from here:
	http://bioseed.mcs.anl.gov/~chenry/data.tgz
	b.) Extract to this directory:
	Model-SEED-core/data/
3.) Set up SQL server
	a.) Set up an SQL server on your computer or identify a server with SQL that you have access to
	b.) Create or identify a user account in the SQL server that Model SEED can use to interact with the server, and give this user account privileges to make schemes.
4.) Configure the Model SEED by running the configuration script
	a.) Copy "Model-SEED-core/config/SettingsTemplate.txt" to "Model-SEED-core/config/Settings.txt"
	b.) Edit "Model-SEED-core/config/Settings.txt" with settings for your installation environment:
		Operating system:			(OS where ModelSEED is installed:windows/osx/linux - an essential parameter)
		SEED username:				(username of SEED account used for interactions with SEED - an essential parameter)
		SEED password:				(password of SEED account used for interactions with SEED - an essential parameter)
		Installation path:			(path to directory where Model SEED is installed - an essential parameter)
		Data directory:				(path to directory where Model SEED flat files are stored - an essential parameter)
		Database username:			(username used to access ModelDB scheme in SQL database - an essential parameter)
		Database password:			(password used to access ModelDB scheme in SQL database - use "NONE" if there is no password)
		Database host:				(hostname where SQL database is installed - an essential parameter) 
		GLPK directory:				(path to directory where GLPK has been installed - an essential parameter)
		CPLEX include directory:	(path to directory with cplex header files - use "NONE" if CPLEX is not available)
		CPLEX library directory:	(path to directory with cplex library files - use "NONE" if CPLEX is not available)
		CPLEX license directory:	(name and location of CPLEX license file - use "NONE" if CPLEX is not available)
	c.) Run the configuration script:
		Model-SEED-core/bin/configureModelSEED.cmd (for windows)
		Model-SEED-core/bin/configureModelSEED.sh (for linux and OSX)
		You may see some warnings when the MFAToolkit builds, but these are okay.
5.) Install needed non-default perl libraries, all readily available through CPAN or perl package manager:
	a.) File/Copy/Recursive
	b.) Spreadsheet/WriteExcel
	c.) XML/DOM
	d.) YAML
	e.) DBD/mysql
6.) Create the empty database tables in SQL
	a.) Run this script: Model-SEED-core/bin/CreateDBScheme.(sh/cmd) (Extension depends on OS)
	b.) If you're having trouble getting this script to run, remember you need to install the MySQL development headers/libraries as well as the standard installation.
	c.) Make sure your user account has privileges to view and modify the ModelDB scheme.
	d.) Should run with no errors.
7.) Load the database scheme
	a.) Download the default database content from here:
	http://bioseed.mcs.anl.gov/~chenry/sql.tgz
	b.) Extract the SQL file, and import it into the "ModelDB" scheme created in step 4
8.) Test environment by running Model Driver with no arguments:
	a.) Run this script: Model-SEED-core/bin/ModelDriver.(sh/cmd)
9.) Update the model SEED
	a.) Run this command in the Model-SEED-core directory:
	"git pull"
	b.) Sometimes you may need to rerun the configuration script
	c.) Soon there will be an "update" script in the "bin" directory that does all of this for you.
