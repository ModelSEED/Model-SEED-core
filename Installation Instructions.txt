1.) Clone the git repository for the Model SEED
	a.) Install git on whatever system you want to install the Model SEED onto
	b.) On the command line, go to the root directory where you want to put the Model SEED installation
	c.) Clone the repository from git with this command:
	"git clone git://github.com/cshenry/Model-SEED-core"
2.) Download and install the flatfile data
	a.) Download the default flat file datafiles from here:
	http://bioseed.mcs.anl.gov/~chenry/data.tgz
	b.) Extract to this directory:
	Model-SEED-core/data/
3.) Configure the Model SEED by running the configuration script
	a.) Copy "Model-SEED-core/SettingsTemplate.txt" to "Model-SEED-core/config/Settings.txt"
	b.) Edit "Model-SEED-core/config/Settings.txt" with settings for your installation environment:
		Operating system:			(OS where ModelSEED is installed:windows/osx/linux - an essential parameter)
		SEED username:				(username of SEED account used for interactions with SEED - an essential parameter)
		SEED password:				(password of SEED account used for interactions with SEED - an essential parameter)
		Installation path:			(path to directory where Model SEED is installed - an essential parameter)
		Data directory:				(path to directory where Model SEED flat files are stored - an essential parameter)
		Database username:			(username used to access ModelDB scheme in SQL database - an essential parameter)
		Database password:			(password used to access ModelDB scheme in SQL database - use "NONE" if there is no password)
		Database host:				(hostname where SQL database is installed - an essential parameter) 
		GLPK directory:				(path to directory where GLPK has been installed - an essential parameter)
		CPLEX include directory:	(path to directory with cplex header files - use "NONE" if CPLEX is not available)
		CPLEX library directory:	(path to directory with cplex library files - use "NONE" if CPLEX is not available)
		CPLEX license directory:	(name and location of CPLEX license file - use "NONE" if CPLEX is not available)
	c.) Run the configuration script:
		Model-SEED-core/bin/configureModelSEED.cmd (for windows)
		Model-SEED-core/bin/configureModelSEED.sh (for linux and OSX)
		You should see no errors.
4.) Install needed non-default perl libraries, all readily available through CPAN or perl package manager:
	a.) File/Copy/Recursive
	b.) Spreadsheet/WriteExcel
	c.) XML/DOM
	d.) YAML
5.) Create the empty database scheme
	a.) Set up an SQL server on your computer or identify a server you have access to
	b.) Run this script: Model-SEED-core/bin/CreateDBScheme.(sh/cmd) (Extension depends on OS)
	c.) Should run with no errors.
6.) Load the database scheme
	a.) Download the default database content from here:
	http://bioseed.mcs.anl.gov/~chenry/sql.tgz
	b.) Extract the SQL file, and import it into the "ModelDB" scheme created in step 4
7.) Test environment by running Model Driver with no arguments:
	a.) Run this script: Model-SEED-core/bin/ModelDriver.(sh/cmd)
8.) Update the model SEED
	a.) Run this command in the Model-SEED-core directory:
	"git pull"
	b.) Sometimes you may need to rerun the configuration script
	c.) Soon there will be an "update" script in the "bin" directory that does all of this for you.
