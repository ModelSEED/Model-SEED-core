1.) Clone the git repository for the Model SEED
	a.) Install git on whatever system you want to install the Model SEED onto
	b.) On the command line, go to the root directory where you want to put the Model SEED installation
	c.) Clone the repository from git with this command:
	"git clone git://github.com/cshenry/Model-SEED-core"
2.) Download and install the flatfile data
	a.) Download the default flat file datafiles from here:
	http://bioseed.mcs.anl.gov/~chenry/data.tgz
	b.) Extract to this directory:
	Model-SEED-core/data/
3.) Configure the Model SEED by running the configuration scripts
	a.) Select the appropriate script depending on your operating system:
		Model-SEED-core/bin/configureModelSEED.cmd (for windows)
		Model-SEED-core/bin/configureModelSEED.sh (for linux and OSX)
	b.) Edit the configuration script arguments based on your installation and database properties:
		-p "installation directory"
		-d "data directory"
		-g "glpk installation directory"
		-c "cplex installation directory" (delete these if you don't have cplex)
		-cl "cplex license file location" (delete these if you don't have cplex)
		-os "windows/linus/osx" 
		-usr "Model SEED username" (your SEED/RAST username is a wise choice here)
		-pwd "Model SEED password" (your SEED/RAST password is a wise choice here)
		-dbhost "database hostname" (could be "localhost")
		-dbuser "database username" (you'll need to make sure this user has appropriate privelages on your server)
		-dbpwd "database password"
	c.) Run the configuration script. You should see no errors.
4.) Install needed non-default perl libraries, all readily available through CPAN or perl package manager:
	a.) File/Copy/Recursive
	b.) Spreadsheet/WriteExcel
	c.) XML/DOM
	d.) YAML
5.) Create the empty database scheme
	a.) Set up an SQL server on your computer or identify a server you have access to
	b.) Run this script: Model-SEED-core/bin/CreateDBScheme.(sh/cmd) (Extension depends on OS)
	c.) Should run with no errors.
6.) Load the database scheme
	a.) Download the default database content from here:
	http://bioseed.mcs.anl.gov/~chenry/sql.tgz
	b.) Extract the SQL file, and import it into the "ModelDB" scheme created in step 4
7.) Test environment by running Model Driver with no arguments:
	a.) Run this script: Model-SEED-core/bin/ModelDriver.(sh/cmd)
8.) Update the model SEED
	a.) Run this command in the Model-SEED-core directory:
	"git pull"
	b.) Sometimes you may need to rerun the configuration script
	c.) Soon there will be an "update" script in the "bin" directory that does all of this for you.
