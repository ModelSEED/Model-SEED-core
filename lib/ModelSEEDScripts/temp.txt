Functional green fluorescent protein fusions and in vitro assays showed plastidial targeting [PMID:16698895]. Disruption of the OLD5 gene is lethal during embryo development [PMID:16698895] [PMID:17452319]. An OLD5 lesion decreased the SufE activity of the protein but not the quinolinate synthase activity [PMID:18978034].	The GRMZM2G142836 gene model lacks the SufE domain but EST evidence indicates that it is present. 
		GRMZM2G061732						The GRMZM2G061732 gene model lacks the SufE domain and part of the NadA (quinolinate synthase) domain. EST evidence indicates that the gene is transcribed.

Subcellular location is unclear. Absence of targeting signals indicates (by default) a cytosolic location; NNAT activity has been detected in potato mitochondria [PMID:21598001].

Various Nudix hydrolases, predicted or shown to be cytosolic or organellar, can hydrolyze NAD(P)H to mononucleotides [PMID:15878881] [PMID:19656905]. These enzymes are generally not highly substrate-specific. The GRMZM2G404897 gene model includes a long N-terminal extension that has no cDNA or EST support and is likely a gene-calling error.

At5g19150		GRMZM5G840928	NAD(P)H hydrate dehydratase	# plastidial (experimental evidence in  maize)	 	Non-photosynthetic plastid - E [PPDB in-house data]	Arabidopsis At5g19150 has 35% identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae YKL151C and 46% identity to mouse Carkd, which have been experimentally identified as NADH(P)X dehydratases [PMID:21994945]. Neither the Arabidopsis nor any other plant homolog has been uncharacterized.	If Arabidopsis At5g19150 and its plant homologs catalyze the dehydration of NAD(P)H hydrate they most probably attack only on the S form and so act in tandem with an epimerase comparable to YjeF [PMID:21994945].

In other organisms, the YjeF domain has been identified as NAD(P)H hydrate epimerase; it occurs as a stand-alone protein in yeast and mammals, and fused to NAD(P)H hydrate dehydratase in many bacteria [PMID:21994945].   	The Arabidopsis At5g49970 YjeF domain has 43% identity to yeast YNL200C, which is an NAD(P)H hydrate epimerase. The GRMZM2G061988 gene model has a long N terminal extension that is not suported by cDNAs or ESTs and is likely a gene-calling error.
